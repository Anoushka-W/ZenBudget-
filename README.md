# ZenBudget - FinanceTracker

ZenBudget is a modern, interactive personal finance app that helps users track spending, visualize savings, and receive smart AI-powered reallocation suggestions to optimize their monthly budgets. This web app was built as part of a hackathon project to demonstrate how agentic AI can empower everyday financial decisions through automation, analysis, and actionable insights.


## Key features- 
- Visual Savings Insights: Track your monthly savings over time using interactive line charts.

- Smart Spending Breakdown: Instantly see where your money goes with categorized spending pie charts.

- AI-Powered Budget Reallocation: Using intelligent logic, the app suggests how to reallocate excess spending from one category (e.g., Shopping) to underfunded but essential ones (e.g., Groceries).

- Reallocation Summaries: Clear bar charts and summaries show how much is being shifted and why — making your budgeting decisions transparent and stress-free.

## Tools used-
- REACT + RECHART
- FLASK
- PYTHON(libraries – pandas, vader)
- TEXTBLOB
- CSV FILE(Synthetic data)
- JSON
- Google Calender API

## How It Works ##
ZenBudget reads your monthly transaction data (from a CSV file), categorizes your expenses, and applies rule-based and agentic AI logic to:
- Detect overspending trends
- Identify underfunded essentials
- Suggest reallocation from surplus to deficit categories

These insights are displayed on a clean, responsive dashboard built with React and Recharts.

  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
